# This is an implementation of the game of SET for the iPhone.

# You can find the original game here: http://www.setgame.com/set/daily_puzzle

# The app has a game view, a rules view and a history/higscores view.

# The highscores are stored in a plist, which is an array of 10 items. Each item is an array of 2 subitems: score - used to sort the items every time and the time it took the user to complete the game! No need for dictionaries here. The data structure is pretty simple.
